In this repository, I display some of the Code That I have used in my games 
They are a bit old, a couple of years ago, they needed a lot of refactoring but I Don't have time to get back to any of them
and they are the only ones I can Publicly share.
I have written a lot more code than these, much better structured, organized, Optimized, Readable, Scalable, and Cleaner.
